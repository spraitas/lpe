        <p>Just about everyone knows about actor Mark Sinclair Vincent. Well, to be more precise, I actually mean,
          everyone knows the actor Mark Sinclair Vincent, who goes by the name Vin Diesel. From the ‘xXx’ movies to the
          ‘Fast and the Furious’ franchise to voicing everyone’s favorite alien conifer Groot in the Marvel Cinematic
          Universe, he’s a very recognizable face – and voice. He’s very good at playing the bad-ass role with his
          finely formed physique, deep voice, and cleanly shaved dome. If you’ve heard of the film’s sequels, ‘The
          Chronicles of Riddick’ or the even-more-simply-titled ‘Riddick,’ you might not be surprised to know that
          ‘Pitch Black’ came before it, either. But this is a strangely-tuned film “franchise,” so it’s possible that
          many people don’t know that the three are connected (and there’s even an animated adventure, ‘Dark Fury,’ that
          takes place in between the films as well).</p>

        <p>
          As a fan of both science-fiction and horror – especially when the two come together – it’s little wonder that
          I’d find ‘Pitch Black’ an extremely intriguing option to revisit time and time again. The plot isn’t
          completely something new, but it does bring neat and interesting characters into a situation that none of us
          would want to be in and makes them all dance for the viewer. Okay – they don’t literally “dance”, but they
          definitely create the right kind of tone set with the atmosphere of the film.</p>

        <p>Set in the distant future, a spaceship carrying a group of people (mostly settlers moving to new colonies)
          encounters a meteor shower and crash lands on an unknown planet, killing all but ten of them. The survivors,
          led by the second-in-command Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), find themselves in a sweltering hot and arid
          landscape with constant sunlight from three orbiting suns. Fry has to not only help the survivors find food
          and water but also contend with a deadly criminal named Riddick (Diesel), who was being transported to a penal
          colony. Unbeknownst to all, every 22 years the planet’s three suns go into a total eclipse for a month, where
          the darkness brings out the planet’s real inhabitants: large, reptilian, vampire-like creatures that swarm the
          surface and dominate the planet in total darkness, killing and eating all life. That time, of course, occurs
          as the survivors are stranded; Fry and her people have no choice but to cooperate with Riddick, who has
          surgically enhanced eyes to see in darkness. Can Riddick lead the group to safety and off the planet before
          they all become dinner for the creatures?</p>
