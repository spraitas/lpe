        <p>Yes, it’s been a whole year and it’s once again time for the Star Wars Celebration! This annual convention is designed to be the “ultimate fan experience” for fans of the ‘Star Wars’ universe of all ages! The Star Wars Celebration is a place where people from all over the world can come together to share their universal enjoyment of one of the biggest franchises of all time! It helps that with Disney managing the license now we have new ‘Star Wars’ content available pretty regularly, so every year the convention seems even bigger and better than the years before! The Star Wars Celebration, which runs from Thursday April 11th 2019 through Monday April 15th, 2019, will be jam packed with huge announcements (including the full name of and hopefully a trailer for ‘Star Wars Episode IX’), celebrity guests, fan activities, film screenings, and of course- exclusive collectibles!</p>

        <p>Today we are bringing you information on some of the coolest new Star Wars Celebration Exclusive convention exclusive collectibles! While some of these have a specialty shared retail partner to bring them to the masses who are unable to attend, the majority of these items are only available exclusively at Star Wars Celebration 2019 (and on Ebay afterwards for what we can assume is a huge mark up)! Check out some of our favorites for this year below!</p>

          Earlier this year Diamond Select Toys announced that they had officially purchased Gentle Giant Ltd. and would continue to release a number of products under the Gentle Giant Ltd. banner. These plans included a number of ‘Star Wars’ pieces, so it’s super exciting to see Diamond Select Toys bringing two of them to Star Wars Celebration as new convention exclusives! Event exclusive items include a 1:6 scale bust of Hera Syndulla from the animated ‘Star Wars: Rebels’ series, as well as a 1:8 scale statue of Darth Maul with his robotic spider-legs as seen in ‘Star Wars: The Clone Wars’ animated series. While both of these pieces are based on characters from stylized animated properties, they have been sculpted to look like they are straight out of a live action film, bringing some real life to these normally animated characters (especially Maul, who looks terrifying!)! These two are available exclusively at Star Wars Celebration 2019, but will also be made available to Gentle Giant Premier Guild Members through their website. Check out the full details below!

        </p>

        <p>Gentle Giant Ltd. Is traveling to Chicago, IL this month to attend Star Wars Celebration April 11-15, and they’re bringing two popular Clone Wars characters – Hera Syndulla and Darth Maul – as this year’s exclusive offerings!

        <p>The captain and heart of the Ghost crew, Hera Syndulla was a gifted pilot and leader. While Hera was a strong commander – and especially adept at dogfighting with TIE fighters – she was also warm and nurturing. The Twi’lek could bring out the best in her team, which consisted of very different personalities, making them believe in themselves, each other, and their struggle against the Empire. Hera will be made available as a 1:6 scale resin bust, for a price of $120.00.

        A deadly, agile Sith Lord trained by the evil Darth Sidious, Darth Maul was a formidable warrior and scheming mastermind. He wielded an intimidating double-bladed lightsaber and fought with a menacing ferocity. Though he fell in battle against Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Zabrak from Dathomir would prove to be much harder to destroy than originally believed. Darth Maul will be depicted with his Force-constructed spider legs in a 1:8 scale Collector’s Gallery statue, available for $200.00.

        Star Wars Premier Guild members will be able to pre-order the busts beginning March 25. All others can come by the Diamond Select Toys/Gentle Giant Ltd. booth between April 11 and 15th! See you in Chicago!</p>
