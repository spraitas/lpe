        <p>I feel like I am likely the target audience for this film.
          Even though I am a (self-described) pop-culture aficionado, and I love to take in as many films, TV series, books, comics, and games as I can, there’s just not enough time to experience everything that’s out there – it’s just not possible.  Somehow over the last 15 years, I’ve managed to accidentally avoid seeing either of the two Guillermo del Toro-led ‘Hellboy’ films: the original cinematic work first released in 2004 and the sequel, ‘Hellboy: The Golden Army’ that came out in 2008.  Further, while I’m aware that the movies are based on the Dark Horse comic book series of the same name that first started to see print in the mid-1990s, I have never read a single issue of the Mike Mignola-helmed works.</p>

        <p>
          Does it seem strange that a reboot of the cinematic series has come now, a mere eleven years after the last installment?  It’s a little Spider-Man-3-into-The-Amazing-Spider-Man-esque, this is true; however, we are in the current prime time of what I call the “snarky superhero,” with darkly-comedic or self-referential comic-book adaptations such as ‘Deadpool,’ ‘Aquaman,’ and ‘The LEGO Batman Movie,’ among others, reigning supreme.  So it seems like the time is right and the audience should be primed for a ‘Hellboy’ film right now then, yeah?</p>

        <p>Well, we probably would be – if the first two quirky films weren’t so “ahead of their time” in terms of their release relative to the cinematic superhero boom.  As it stands, trotting Hellboy back out to the silver screen now – especially as a reboot of a two-film series that probably didn’t need a reboot – feels like an unnecessary move.  A fairly entertaining move, to be sure, but rather unnecessary.  Let’s leave the latter part of that sentence behind for a bit and dive into the former part, shall we?</p>

        <p>David Harbour (he of ‘Stranger Things’ fame, among other films & TV stuff from which you might recognize him) takes over the titular role of the large red demon with a soft spot for humans – Ron Perlman had played the role in the previous films, but my guess is that at 68 years old, he wasn’t looking to get back in the action-hero and head-to-toe-prosthetic saddle any time soon.  This story, from all accounts, fairly faithfully adapts several key plot points from the Mignola comic series, whereas the del Toro two-pack of movies took many liberties and essentially let the iconic genre director craft his own tale using the existing Hellboy universe of characters, locations, etc.</p>
